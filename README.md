# fetched-issue-list
A list of some of the issues(not security, yet ;) ) I have found while working with day-to-day tools

# Why does this repo exist?
I believe that in order to work efficiently, you must me well-versed with tools you use. In order to be well-versed, you need to move out of the `simple or hacky implementation` zone and must really know the tools in-and-out. In the process of knowing them in-and-out, did find some bugs(couldn't believe myself at first), some of which were not bugs but just my lack of knowledge. So here is a compiled list for the same.
